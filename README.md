# Customer-Segments
 In this project, I applied supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind on data collected for the U.S. census to help Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data. I explored the data by selecting a small subset to sample  CharityML (a fictitious charity organization) identify people most likely to donate to their cause..This entailed first exploring and determine if any product categories highly correlate with one another. Afterwards, I preprocessed the data by scaling  how the census data is recorded and then applying a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate each product category and then identifying (and removing) unwanted outliers. Currently on the step where I will apply PCA  the data into a workable format. Subsequently I evaluated several supervised learners on the data, and considered which is transformations to the data and implement clustering algorithms to segment the transformed customer data. Finally, I will  best suited for the solution and then optimised the model. compare the segmentation found with an additional labeling and consider ways this information could assist the wholesale distributor with future service changes.
